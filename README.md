**Introduction:** In today’s era of information technology, more and more data is stored in systems. Searching and using data becomes more accurate when the data is arranged in a certain order. However, there are many sorting algorithms, which makes choosing the right one for the user’s needs and purposes difficult. For beginners, such as high school students or university students, understanding how these algorithms work through code is also a challenge. To address these issues, the application “Simulation of Sorting Algorithms” was created. This application visually simulates sorting algorithms through an interface, helping users clearly understand how each algorithm works and compare them with one another.

**Main interface**:
